# thegoodshipnorthcarolina
This is a ship I made for fun and posted on r/northcarolina Feel free to edit and remix to your hearts content. 

This is a chaotic file, im sorry I got busy with life and stuff and so things just got thrown places cause I was going fast.
I dont even think I spelled every thing correctly BUT! its free and no one paid for it so I don't feel too bad

Parenting got a bit crazy... 

Some labels might be different cause I wasnt sure how copyright and stuff works. 

That other ship was originaly something I was working on but changed my mind and made North Carolina into a ship.
